# ahk_script
My AutoHotkeys script that I use daily at work and home.

I use the function keys as mapped on my keyboard. To use these as media keys, change the function key number to the key number of your choice.

The "^Esc" shortcut minimizes the currently active window.


## Shortcut keys
F1 = Open File Explorer to "This PC"  
F2 = Open Firefox  
F4 = Open Spotify  
F5 = Skip back  
F6 = Skip Forward  
F7 = Play/Pause media  
F9 = Mute sounds  
F10 = Decrease volume  
F11 = Increase volume  
^Esc = ctrl + esc  
^\` = ctrl + \`
