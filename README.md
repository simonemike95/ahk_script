# ahk_script
My AutoHotkeys script that I use daily at work and home.

I use the function keys as mapped on my keyboard. To use these as media keys, change the function key number to the key number of your choice.

The "^Esc" shortcut minimizes the currently active window.


## Shortcut keys
F_ = Function key number  
^Esc = ctrl + esc
